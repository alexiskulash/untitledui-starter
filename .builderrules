This is a Vite app that uses the Untitled UI design system. The Untitled UI design system is described here:

https://www.untitledui.com/react/application-ui
https://www.untitledui.com/react/integrations/vite

Do a web search to verify how it works.

The following is also important:

* Icons used must actually be available in the @untitledui/icons package. Ensure all icons actually exist in the package before using them.
* Accessibility best practices should be followed. Ensure background colors and text have a high contrast.
* If I ask you to add a new page, add a link in the nav for it too.
